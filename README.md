# Phishing-Detection

This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to detect whether a given URL is legitimate or phishing. It uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on URL features to classify suspicious web links in real time.

ðŸš€ Features
1. URL-based phishing detection
2. Extracts important features (e.g., presence of @, URL length, https usage, etc.)
3. Trained using a labeled dataset
4. Simple and responsive web interface using Flask
5. Displays prediction result as "Legitimate" or "Phishing" with color-coded output

ðŸ§  Tech Stack
Python 3
Scikit-learn (for model training)
Flask (for web app)
HTML/CSS (for UI)
Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)
Pickle (for saving the model)
